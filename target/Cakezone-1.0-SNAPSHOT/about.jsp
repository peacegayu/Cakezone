        <h3>Cake-A-Licious products</h3>
        <p>"A bakery is an establishment that produces and sells flour-based food baked in an oven such as bread, cookies, cakes, doughnuts, bagels, pastries, and pies. Some retail bakeries are also categorized as caf√©s, serving coffee and tea to customers who wish to consume the baked goods on the premises. </p>
        <p>A bakery concept statement should include the basic information about what your bakery is and does, how it is unique, and who it serves. The latter should include the location as well as your target customer demographic.</p>
